This was a simple CLI game made for the last assignment for my second year
trimester one class, Programming languages course.

The game has a CLI menu to which you follow the instructions upon lunch. It is
a basic gambling game based on three options: Pick the queen, Guess a
number, and random number match. Hope you enjoy.
